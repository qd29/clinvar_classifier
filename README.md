# Leveraging ClinVar for Accurate and Automated Germline Variant Interpretation
<br>
This repository contains scripts used for ClinVar data extraction and for training, testing, and validating a binary germline variant classification tool. The classifier is designed to predict variant pathogenicity by leveraging submissions from high-concordance ClinVar submitters.<br><br>
